Dodo Pizza app

First of all, my main activity. I tried to do it like cards. Also I added the part after search, where you can scroll it, as in original app. So when you click it, the others become disabled (in our case grey), clicked one will be orange. However it still contains bags.

Search works correctly. It supposed to be searchview, but i couldn't do it, but did it with EditText

Pizza Details. I added the function which increases amount of pizzas, which also increase its price.

Thank you for giving such fun and stressfull labwork. The amount of time that I spend to do a recycler view, ha.... 
However, I tried to do a bonus task. Key word is TRIED :( 

Hope I get good mark, thank you again
